# Satoshi's Razor

A trust-minimized scientific verification platform and onchain formal verification competition marketplace - DeSci for mathematical proofs.

## Overview

Satoshi's Razor is a platform that creates an open market for formal verification (FV) tasks while preserving mathematical proofs on a public blockchain. It represents a fundamental shift toward decentralized science (DeSci) by removing trusted intermediaries from mathematical verification. The platform enables:

- Trust-minimized verification of mathematical proofs and formal verification tasks
- Modular, incentivized formal verification tasks
- Permissionless competition for FV jobs
- Trustless package management for Lean
- Immutable record of proven mathematical theorems
- Elimination of traditional gatekeepers in mathematical verification

## Why Now?

The timing for Satoshi's Razor is particularly compelling due to several converging factors:

### Mathematical Formalization Progress
- The Lean community is making unprecedented progress in formalizing mathematics through projects like [the Xena Project](https://www.ma.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/)
- [Lean's 2024 developments](https://xenaproject.wordpress.com/2024/01/20/lean-in-2024/) show rapid advancement in mathematical formalization capabilities
- The [Condensed Number Forms Project](https://leanprover-community.github.io/con-nf/) demonstrates the feasibility of formalizing complex mathematics
- Active community development through platforms like [Lean Zulip](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/)
- Growing adoption of formal methods in critical infrastructure verification
- Continued advancements in the application of AI to Formal Methods

### Previous Attempts and Lessons
Several previous attempts have provided valuable insights:
- [MathCoin](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/271.pdf): A prediction market for open math problems
- [ProofMarket](https://web.archive.org/web/20140110015900/https://proofmarket.org/problem/recent): An early attempt at a proof marketplace
- [PiÂ²](https://harmonic.fun/news.html): Focused on term rewriting systems verification

These projects were ahead of their time, lacking today's mature tooling and infrastructure.

## AI and Decentralized Computing Era

As we enter an age where AI systems approach and potentially exceed PhD-level cognitive capabilities, the landscape of mathematical discovery and formal verification is transforming:

- **Capital-Driven Knowledge Creation**: Access to state-of-the-art AI systems is increasingly concentrated in large corporations and governments, shifting mathematical discovery from individual researchers to institutional compute power.
- **Democratizing AI Access**: By creating transparent reward pools for mathematical problems, we enable decentralized GPU clusters and AI systems to compete in solving critical problems while ensuring fair compensation.
- **AI-Resistant Design**: The platform works seamlessly with both human mathematicians and AI agents, ensuring value capture remains decentralized even as AI capabilities advance.
- **Standardization**: Creates a standardized format for expressing mathematical problems that makes them immediately targetable by AI systems, with inference costs covered by reward pools.

## Scientific Community Impact

The platform represents a paradigm shift in mathematical verification and DeSci:

- **Trust Minimization**: Eliminates the need for trusted academic gatekeepers in proof verification
- **Knowledge Preservation**: Creates an immutable, generation-preserving record of mathematical proofs that can't be lost or disputed
- **Verification Standardization**: Reduces debate about the epistemic nature of proofs by requiring machine-checkable verification
- **Resource Allocation**: Helps direct computational resources toward the most valued unsolved problems
- **Open Science**: Promotes the creation of open-source proofs while respecting the need for temporary privacy in competitive scenarios
- **Collaboration Bridge**: Creates a natural interface between traditional academic mathematics and industrial formal verification needs
- **Decentralized Peer Review**: Replaces traditional peer review with cryptographic verification of correctness
